***CPU, Memory, I/O, the three important components.

Numerical system: number repretation: 2's complement

ALU to mathematical / logical calculation

Binary numbers: signed and unsigned
signed numbers: use the first digit to check if negative

*use n bits to represent: 2^n - 1 numbers can be represented.

Find 2's complement of a number:
add flip of A and A together, then plus 1 == A's 2's complement.

Extend number bits?
positive: simply add 0 is fine.

negative: add 1 before the head.



**Overflow:  positive + positive = negative
(in general: have impossible results)

subtraction:
A - B = A + (-B)
-B is the 2's complement of B
lecture 2: P37: not required.


**Fraction number repretation
Question: where to put radix point?
A: will not be decided.

General: S * B^E
normalized: 1.bbbbbbb.. * 2^E

components: biased exponent E: 
actual value of E = biased exponent - a fixed bias
