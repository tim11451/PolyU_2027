CPU, Memory, I/O, the three important components.

Numerical system: number repretation: 2's complement

ALU to mathematical / logical calculation

Binary numbers: signed and unsigned
signed numbers: use the first digit to check if negative

*use n bits to represent: 2^n numbers can be represented.
